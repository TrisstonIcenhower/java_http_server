      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This webserver is a very basic implementation of an HTTP server written
        in Java. It was an attempt to make a simple, working, webserver without
        using any of the existing HTTP functionality.
      </p>

      <h2>Purpose of the Project</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of this project is to dive deep and obtain a better
        understanding of the request response cycle in the HTTP protocol. It all
        started when I was teaching myself a bit more about the underlying
        functionality of frameworks like
        <a
          href="https://expressjs.com/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >Express.js</a
        >
        and
        <a
          href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >Spring Boot</a
        >. I've read about how "http sits on top of TCP", but I never could
        really understand what that meant in practice. That's when I decided to
        work on this project to better understand all of this. This project has
        been a ton of fun and a great learning opportunity. I hope you enjoy the
        project! To see my other work check out my
        <a href="/about">about page</a> to learn more about me and what I do!
        Thanks for checking it out, and feel free to use this template to make
        your own server with my project. Happy coding!
